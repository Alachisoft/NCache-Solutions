## Introduction
This project demonstrates how stream can be processed in NCache server nodes using continuous query which not only provides super fast results but also allows you to monitor and do actions on that data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Following are required before you can run this app:

 - NCache Enterprise (version 5.0 SP2)
 - DotNET Core Runtime (version 3.0)
 - DotNET Core SDK (version 3.0)
 - Visual Studio (VS2019)

Note that the app has been tested with the mentioned versions.

### Installing
*Please ensure that the prerequisites are installed before continuing.*

#### Create Cache

A cache needs to be linked with the app. 
On installing NCache, two caches are created by the name of `mypartitionedcache` and `myreplicatedcache`.
If the default cache is not available, Create a new cache. [Docs](https://www.alachisoft.com/resources/docs/ncache/admin-guide/create-new-cache-cluster.html?tabs=windows)

#### Link Cache with App

Mention this cache name in "CacheName" attribute of following files: 
1. \StreamProcessing\StreamToNCache\appsettings.json 
1. \StreamProcessing\StreamProcessingUI\appsettings.json
   {
	   "CacheName":  "mypartitionedcache"
   }


### Starting the App

This solution contains three projects:
1.	Models
2.	StreamProcessingUI
3.	StreamToNCache
Build the project in windows environment and run StreamProcessingUI and StreamToNCache using Visual Studio. Upon running, two separate console windows will be opened.

## Working

Following is an explanation to the working of different parts of stream processing solution.
1.	Stream Processing UI will register continuous query for each category of customer and print all the results of each category and decide what to offer to each category by retaining those customers data in cache.
2.	StreamToNCache will push customers data into cache.
Customers data that is being streamed in NCache and it consist of 4 categories.
•	Customer with orders less than 4 which are less valuable customers (no need to retain those customers data in Cache so these customers are expired using data expiration).
•	Customer with orders greater than 4 and less than 7 which are valuable customers and tagged with “Bronze Customers” (Data retained by removing expiration).
•	Customer with orders greater than 6 and less than 10 which are more valuable customers and tagged with “Silver Customers” (Data retained by removing expiration).
•	Customer with orders greater than 9 which are most valuable customers and tagged with “Gold Customers” (Data retained by removing expiration).
As the customers data is being tagged according to their importance we can easily do the analysis and change strategy by providing coupons to and discounts to increase business.


### Architecture
All parts of the app are connected to an NCache feature. Following is a detail on each feature's implementation and use:
