	program	NCache and all whole or partial copies of it, including portions merged into other programs.
	
	Following are the terms and conditions to use the Software. By clicking on the “Agree” or “Accept” or similar button
	at the end of this Agreement, or downloading and installing the Software on your computer you agree to the terms and
	conditions set forth in this agreement.
	
1. Evaluation Period
	The Client is authorized to install and evaluate the Software for a 60-day evaluation period ("Evaluation Period") 
	commencing upon installation of the Software by the Client, at no charge. Client may obtain an extension key from the 
	Licensor to extend the Evaluation Period from 30 days to 120 days beyond the original 60 days, at no charge.

	During the Evaluation Period, the Client may only use the Software for evaluation purpose and not in a live situation 
	except when a written permission is obtained from the Licensor for any other use.
	
2. Software Limitations
	During the Evaluation Period, the Software has all the features and functions enabled to allow Client full access to 
	the Software. During the Evaluation Period, Software has some performance and throughput limitations built in. The 
	Client may obtain a Trial License Key from the Licensor to activate the Trial copy of the Software that removes all 
	performance and throughput limitations, at no cost.

	During the Evaluation Period, the Licensor provides technical support as a courtesy through email and phone during 
	regular office hours of 7am-5pm US Eastern Time. The Client must first send an email to the Licensor support team 
	with questions or full problem description and then somebody will likely respond via email or phone within 1-3 
	business days.
	
4. End of Evaluation Period
